    SEQUOIA_Settings

The `SEQUOIA_Settings` struct stores the key settings required for solving optimization problems using the SEQUOIA method. It allows configuring various solvers, convergence criteria, and numerical settings.

# Fields

- `outer_method::Symbol`: Specifies the outer optimization method. Valid options include:
    - `:SEQUOIA`: SEQUOIA method.
    - `:QPM`: Quadratic Programming Method.
    - `:AugLag`: Augmented Lagrangian Method.
    - `:IntPt`: Interior Point Method.

- `inner_solver::Symbol`: Specifies the inner solver used to solve unconstrained subproblems. Valid options include:
    - `:LBFGS`: Limited-memory BFGS.
    - `:BFGS`: BFGS solver.
    - `:Newton`: Newtonâ€™s method.
    - `:GradientDescent`: Gradient Descent method.
    - `:NelderMead`: Nelder-Mead method.

- `feasibility::Bool`: Determines if the solver is solving a feasibility problem (true) or optimizing an objective function (false).

- `resid_tolerance::Real`: Residual tolerance for constraints. The solver considers the constraints satisfied when the residual is below this value.

- `max_iter_outer::Int`: Maximum number of iterations allowed for the outer solver.

- `max_time_outer::Real`: Maximum computational time (in seconds) for the entire optimization process.

- `conv_crit::Symbol`: Convergence criterion for the inner solver. Valid options include:
    - `:GradientNorm`: Based on the gradient norm.
    - `:MaxIterations`: Based on a maximum number of iterations.
    - `:MaxTime`: Based on maximum computational time.
    - `:ConstraintResidual`: Based on constraint residuals.
    - `:NormMaxIt`: Either gradient norm below tolerance or iterations exceeded.
    - `:MaxItMaxTime`: Either number of iterations exceeded or maximum time exceeded.
    - `:NormMaxTime`: Either gradient norm below tolerance or maximum time exceeded.
    - `:CombinedCrit`: A combination of gradient norm, number of iterations, or maximum time exceeded.
    - `:AdaptiveIterations`: Adaptive inner iterations based on outer iteration count.

- `max_iter_inner::Union{Nothing, Int}`: Maximum number of iterations for the inner solver. `Nothing` indicates that the default behavior of the inner solver is used.

- `max_time_inner::Union{Nothing, Real}`: Maximum time (in seconds) for each inner solve call. `Nothing` for no limit or a positive real number to impose a time limit.

- `cost_tolerance::Union{Nothing, Real}`: Desired optimality gap. The solver stops when the difference between the current solution and the optimal cost is below this threshold.

- `cost_min::Union{Nothing, Real}`: Minimum allowed cost value to help detect unbounded problems.

- `solver_params::Union{Nothing, Vector{Float64}}`: Optional solver-related parameters, such as step sizes, penalty parameters, or Lagrange multipliers.
